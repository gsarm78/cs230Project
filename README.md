# Stanford CS230 Project (Winter2020)
## Precipitation Nowcasting using Deep Learning techniques
 
 Project is attempting to nowcast precipitation based on radar images, using DL techniques.

 The notebook titled "nowcastingmodel.ipynb" contains the baseline DL model which is based on ConvLSTM.
 It receive an input sequence of N images and predicts a sequence of M images.
 (Notice: in the notebook, N = M = 8 images).
 
 Please run the "nowcastingmodel.ipynb" using Google Colab
 
 Predictions animation:

There are additional implementations using different DL architectures
in the Models folder.
