## Model 2 (Experimental)
Precipitation nowcasting model which is built upon two Autoencoders - one for the motion and another for the content, that cooperate to predict future image. The network independently captures the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics.

Inspired by MCNet network.

Version 2 of the model is tested on the Moving MNIST dataset.
