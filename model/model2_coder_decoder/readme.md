Model 2 (Experimental)
Precipitation nowcasting model which is built upon a CNN-ConvLSTM motion encoder and a CNN content encoder that cooperate to predict future image. The network independently captures the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. Inspired by MCNet network.
Tested on the Moving MNIST dataset
